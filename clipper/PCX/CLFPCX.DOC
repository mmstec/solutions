                ® Clipper "Fast" EGA/VGA PCX Display Library ¯
                           For Clipper Summer '87 &
                                Clipper 5.0x


This is the documentation for two libraries: CLFPCX87.LIB and CLFPCX50.LIB.
The first for Clipper Summer '87, the latter for Clipper 5.0x (5.0 and 5.01).

These libraries provides a function that display's some PCX files, in an
efficient, fast and easy manner. The memory overhead by CLFPCX is very
little, as the core has been programmed directly in Assembly, and there
are also very few options for extra displays etc... CLFPCX is ideal
for your application just to display the Logo of your Company/Organisation. 
I suggest to use other complete libraries for more elaborate graph functions.

The display of the PCX is quite fast, as the decoding and writing of the
actual picture is completely handled by Assembly routines.

For each library, the source code to the FastPCX() function has been supplied,
would you want to add some more robust error checking, or display more
pictures in a row, or whatever..

Syntax:		FastPCX(cFileName) --> nCode

cFileName	Name of PCX file, complete (you must include .PCX!).

nCode:		Meaning:
----------------------------------------------------------
0		PCX displayed OK, still in graphmode.
		Do whatever you want, (inkey()?), and return to
		normal mode with the txtMode() function, also in CLFPCX??.LIB.
1		file not Found. You must include .PCX!
2		Not a PCX file!
3		Not a proper Format. The PCX file has an unknown Format.

Currently, The CLFPCX?? libraries support only these formats:

Adaptor:	Video Mode:	Resolution (WxHxColors):
--------------------------------------------------------
VGA 		13h 		320x200x256
VGA		12h		640x480x16
EGA/VGA		10h		640x350x16

As those are the ones generally used to make acceptable pictures, it is
probably enough.

FastPCX() does not do much checking, and also only allows relatively Small
PCX files to be displayed (<64Kb), This because it reads the whole
picture at once. You may want to add code to check for the PCX file's size,
you could also check if there is enough memory to load the File..?
But, assuming it is used to display the logo, There probably is enough
memory.

The libraries are Public Domain, meaning that you may use them in your
application without restrictions. You may not change anything when
you distribute the libraries, without mentionning exactly what you changed.
You may also not Charge anything for the libraries. I decline all
responsability when using this library; you're free to use them, but you're
on your own.

I hope you will enjoy and appreciate using this (or these) library(ies)..
